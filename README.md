# BrainyKidz Solar System Simulation

This project contains a simple interactive solar system model built with [three.js](https://threejs.org/).

Open `index.html` in a web browser to explore the planets, moons, and rings.
Click on any object to view a short description.

If the browser blocks `script.js` when you open the file directly, start a
simple HTTP server from this directory:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then browse to <http://localhost:8000/> to run the simulation without
crossâ€‘origin issues.
